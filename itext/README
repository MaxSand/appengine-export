Port of iText to AppEngine, based on iText-2.1.7

Changes are principally substitution of java.awt and javax.imageio class 
with those from appengine-awt.

Some classes (e.g. barcodes) have been removed because ActivityInfo isn't 
using them and they had a dependency on an AWT component for some reason.
