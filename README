AppEngine Export Libaries


This is a rag-tag collection of java libraries used by ActivityInfo (www.activityinfo.org)
to generate documents for export, including:

- PDF
- RTF
- HTML
- PPT
- PNG
 
As well image manipulation used for maps and generating
map icons on the fly.

The pure-java implementation of the java.awt and javax.imageio
libraries are based on the Apache Harmony implementation, via
(http://code.google.com/p/appengine-awt/)

Most of these libraries don't do any heavy-duty image manipulation
but rather just reference forbidden classes like java.awt.Color 
or java.awt.Rectangle.
